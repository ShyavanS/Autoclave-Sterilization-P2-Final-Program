# Autoclave-Sterilization-P2-Final-Program
A program written to sterilize surgical instruments in autoclaves via a simulation through Quanser.

This program was part of the second major project in the first year engineering course ENGINEER 1P13 at McMaster. A robotic arm made by Quanser was simulated and had to sterilize a series of surgical instruments in autoclaves and sort them accordingly even when given the instruments in a random order. Each group had a different variation of this problem.
